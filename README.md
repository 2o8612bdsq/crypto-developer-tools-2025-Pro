## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how crypto-developer-tools integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Core Concept: The API Bridge

At its heart, the integration is built on **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** provided by the exchanges themselves (like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.). These APIs are a set of defined rules and protocols that allow an external software application (your automated trading bot or portfolio manager) to communicate directly with the exchange's systems.

Think of it as a secure "messenger" that delivers your commands (e.g., "buy 0.1 BTC") and fetches data (e.g., "what is the current price of ETH?") without you needing to use the website's graphical interface.

---

### The Two Main Types of APIs Used

1.  **REST APIs (for Actions and Data):**
    *   **Purpose:** Used for executing trades, managing orders, and accessing account information (portfolio, trade history).
    *   **How it Works:** Your software sends an HTTP request (like a web browser does) to a specific URL endpoint provided by the exchange. The request contains instructions and is cryptographically signed with your API
